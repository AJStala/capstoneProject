# capstoneProject

Interests:
For this project, I am interested in creating an interactable 3D game that includes both visual and audio elements.

Parts of a real time strategy game:
1. Basics (First Goal would be the implementation of these)
   - Terrain for the Units to move around in
   - Units that can move
     - Pathfinding
   - Units that can attack things
     - Multiple Unit attacks (Optional)
   - A way to select Units both individually and in groups
     - A way to assign groups (Optional)
   - A way to get more Units
     - Spawn from buildings or off the map
2. Advanced (Second Goal would be the implementation of these)
   - Units that can move in formation
     - Multiple formations (Optional)
     - Formation pathfinding
   - Enemy Units that will be controlled by an AI opponent
     - Basic AI that can attack player units
       - Likely to have unlimited vision and simply throw units at player
     - A way to restrict AI “vision” of the map
     - Improve AI and make it able to handle units better
    - A way for the AI opponent to get more units
      - Will be the same as player
    - One or more objectives to complete to achieve a victory or failure state
      - Kill all enemies
        - Likely to be the easiest to implement
      - Capture area
      - Hold area for X time
3. More Advanced (Third Goal would be the implementation of these. Largely optional and would only be added if time allows.)
   - Multiple levels 
   - Different types of objectives per level (Optional)
   - Advanced mechanics (All optional)
     - Take cover
     - Garrison buildings
     - Unit stances
   - Multiple Unit types (Preferable but still optional)
